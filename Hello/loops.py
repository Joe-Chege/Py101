# In understanding loops how to use elif, if and else statement  

a = int(input("Enter the value of a "))
b = int(input("Enter the value of b "))

if (a>b):

"""The code has used the input fuction and int showing it expects an integer 
Conditional operators are evident in the if, else and elif statement """
