"""Loops come in handy Especially to avoid repetitions"""
# For loops works well with other fuction like range

# Here is an example using range

for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i) #One has to call i for this code basically a fuction

# The code prints from 1 to 10. Something worth noting is that indexing comes in handy
